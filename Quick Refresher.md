### 1. Access Control
Access control in AWS involves managing permissions and roles to restrict or grant access to AWS resources. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the primary service for controlling access, allowing you to create users, roles, and policies to enforce access controls.

#### Scenario-based Questions:
1. **Q1:** You need to grant a new developer access to an S3 bucket, but you want to ensure they can only upload files and cannot delete any existing objects. How would you achieve this?
   - **A:** Create an IAM policy that grants `s3:PutObject` permission but denies `s3:DeleteObject` for the specific S3 bucket and attach this policy to the developerâ€™s IAM user or role.

2. **Q2:** An application running on EC2 instances requires temporary access to DynamoDB. What is the best way to provide this access?
   - **A:** Attach an IAM role with the necessary DynamoDB permissions to the EC2 instances. This approach allows the application to assume the role and gain temporary access to DynamoDB.

3. **Q3:** How would you restrict access to specific actions in your AWS account based on the user's IP address?
   - **A:** Create an IAM policy with a condition that restricts access based on the `aws:SourceIp` condition key, specifying the allowed IP address range.

4. **Q4:** A user needs access to an S3 bucket only during business hours. How can you implement this?
   - **A:** Create an IAM policy that includes a condition using `aws:RequestTime` to allow access only during specified hours.

5. **Q5:** How can you grant an external partner limited access to your AWS resources without creating an IAM user for them?
   - **A:** Create an IAM role with the required permissions and enable cross-account access by allowing the external partner's AWS account to assume the role.

   - **A:** By setting up a CloudFront distribution, the static assets (images, CSS, JS) of the site can be cached at edge locations closer to the users, reducing latency and improving load times.

2. **Q2:** How can you restrict access to content distributed by CloudFront to only your authenticated users?
   - **A:** Use signed URLs or signed cookies in CloudFront, which requires users to authenticate and receive a unique URL or cookie that grants access to the content.

3. **Q3:** Your company wants to reduce costs for serving media files globally. How can CloudFront help achieve this?
   - **A:** Use CloudFront to cache and serve media files from edge locations, reducing the load on your origin servers and lowering data transfer costs from the origin.

4. **Q4:** How would you use CloudFront to deliver dynamic content with low latency?
   - **A:** Configure CloudFront to use multiple origins, including an EC2 instance or an Application Load Balancer, to deliver dynamic content with the same low latency as static content.

5. **Q5:** How can you ensure that CloudFront only allows secure connections to your content?
   - **A:** Configure CloudFront to require HTTPS for all requests, and optionally, enforce HTTP to HTTPS redirection at the distribution level.
